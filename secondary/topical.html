          <h1>Universal Design</h1>
          <h2>A discussion on the impact of universal design og society</h2>
          <p>
            In this article i will discuss the “European Accessibility Act”
            which is planned to be enacted in 2025 across all members states. It
            is based on the notion that “accessibility should be achieved by the
            systematic removal and prevention of barriers, preferably through a
            universal design or ‘design for all’ approach, which contributes to
            ensuring access for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with
            others.»
         </p>
            <p>
            The purpose of the act is to ensure «persons who have any
            physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments, age related
            impairments, or other human body performance related causes,
            permanent or temporary, which, in interaction with various barriers,
            result in their reduced access to products and services.
         </p>
            <p>
            The impact of universal design is major. This contributes to everyone who wants to use an
            electronic device, will be able to use it. It does not matter if you have physical or mental
            problems, because a universal design will make it so that you can use it even with those problems.
            If we were to implement the law, it would accelerate the progress of universal design in many devices.

            Mobile phones is one of the products that have become an important part of life. It is used to do many tasks in the modern world,
            such as contact, purchase, sales, presentation, social media, access to websites and information and
            many other tasks.
            When we talk about disability people then mobile phones provide a number of services that can help such
            as voice recognition and customizable colors.
            The goal of the European Accessibility Act is that all phones must meet a high standard for accessibility,
            so that as many people as possible benefit from it.

            <!--We uploaded the picture and put it in the "images"-folder, then we linked to it via the "img"-tag folloved up by the "src"-attribut.
            Then we added an "alt"-attribut in case the image won`t load. Then we added the class so we could design it in the CSS-file.
            Lastly we used the "figcaption"-element to get a caption under the image where the photographer is displayed.-->

            <h3>Three ways the mobile phone fails to comply to with key principals in universal design </h3>
            <p>
              <!--The "ol"-element represents a numbered list, with the "il"-element representing the start of a new number in the sequence.
              The "br"-element represents the start of a new line-->
            <ol>
            <li>Lack of accessibility features. The importance of including various accessibility features for people with
            various disabilities is key for universal design. If a smartphone lacks essential accessibility features such
            as magnification options, adjusting font sizes or color contrasts, it will affect people who have bad eyesight
            or even color blind.</li><br>
            
            <li>Bad physical design. If a smartphone has for example sharp edges, buttons that are small and close to each other,
            or even if it is too heavy for some to hold it with one hand. it may become hard to use for some and impossible for others.
            People who have issues with their hand or has limited hand strength will be affected by this. </li><br>
            
            <li> Low durability and robustness. A universally designed smartphone should be able to handle different temperatures,
            climates and environments. It should also be designed for everyday use and accidents that come with it such as spills
            or drops. If a smartphone is not designed like this, it will affect people who are physically disabled and people who
            for example work in tough environments. </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Three ways the mobile phone complies with the key principals of universal design</h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Accessibility features: Screen readers: smartphones come equipped with screen readers, like VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack
            on Android, which enable impaired users to navigate the device using feedback. Magnification and Larg Text: Users with low
            vision can take advantage of features that allow them to enlarge text and interface elements or display them in larger fonts. </li><br>
            <li>Customization Options: Font and Display Settings: Smartphones offer a variety of styles, sizes and display settings that allow
            users to personalize the device according to their preferences. </li><br>
            <li>Voice Control and Gesture Navigation: Voice commands: users can control their smartphones. Perform tasks without interaction using
            voice assistants like Siri og Google Assistant. This feature greatly aids individuals with mobility impairments. </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>The poptential impact</h3>
            <p>
            Life will be easier for those who are less fortunate. The act of strictly enforcing universal design will probably make life easier for
            disabled people since they will be able to use what others have benefitted from for so long.<br>
            <br>The tech industry might take a hit from this in the short term. If strict enforcement is enacted swiftly, then tech companies will have
            to quickly follow the new procedures, something that might affect them if they’re not allowed to sell their pervious products. And even
            if the change is not swift, they will still have to spend money on new products. In the long term, however, the tech industry might benefit
            from this given that more people can use their products.
            </p>
            <!--Did the same thing here as with the last image. Added the image from the folder and added an alt-attribut, a class for the CSS and a caption.-->

            <h3>Potential consequences</h3>
            <p>
            Making smartphones having universal design could lead to overfocus on the universal design leading to a decrease in quality for the
            non-disabled users or creating a system that focuses so heavily on disabled that it will become difficult or unusable for the common users.
            There is also the possibility to miss use the term disability leading to wasteful design catering to the unneeded. <br>
            The main loss would come from producers as the cost of redesigning and innovating would take both time and money. Mainly smaller companies
            looking to get into the market would face a bigger wall than the big companies that have both time and money.<br>
            <br>The main benefactors of this change would be the disabled having access to smartphones in the modern era where phones are becoming more integrated
            into society. There could also be benefits for people with harsher work environments to have a sturdier and more advanced phone. <br>
            <br>There could be indirect environmental consequences as forcing universal design could lead to an increase in production cost which leads to the
            wish for decrease in cost by taking a less ecofriendly route in production. <br>
            Companies that do make a universal design would be more socially accepted for creating designs for helping the disabled.
            The biggest economic consequence would be the increase of prices in smartphones as well as the decrease in competition for the smartphone market.
